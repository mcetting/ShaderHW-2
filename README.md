# ShaderHW-2

Only the assets are pushed because github wouldnt upload the entire project file. I also had to downsize the cubemap because github didnt like how fat it was.

This is the second hw for the shader class at ucsc the first part contrains a tron shader including an outline shader on a phong shader and a bloom shader on the camera.

Heres the executables for both scenes
